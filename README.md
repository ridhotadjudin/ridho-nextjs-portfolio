## 🏗 Design Patterns

### Component Composition

Each section of the portfolio is an independent React component with its own state, animations, and styling. Components like `Experience.tsx` (8.2 KB) and `Projects.tsx` (7.4 KB) encapsulate complex rendering logic — timelines, card layouts, and filter interactions — while exposing a clean, declarative interface to the parent page.

### App Router Architecture

The project uses Next.js 16 App Router with server components by default, selectively opting into client components (`"use client"`) only where interactivity is needed (theme switching, animations, form handling). This maximizes server-side rendering performance while preserving rich client-side experiences.

### Theme Provider Pattern

`ThemeProvider.tsx` wraps the application with `next-themes`, providing a context-based theme system. Components consume the current theme reactively, enabling instant visual updates without page reloads or layout shifts.

### Animation Orchestration

Framer Motion is used with a layered approach — page-level transitions in the layout, section-level entrance animations triggered by scroll position, and micro-interactions on interactive elements. Animation variants are defined per component, keeping motion design co-located with the UI it enhances.
